Mushrooms are fungi that typically grow above ground and have a visible fruiting body that consists of a stem and a cap. There are many different species of mushrooms.
Mushrooms can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even urban areas.
Truffles, on the other hand, are a type of fungi that grow underground, typically near the roots of trees. They have a round or spiky shape and are usually smaller than mushrooms. Truffles are difficult to cultivate and are often found using trained animals,
such as pigs or dogs, that are attracted to the strong smell of the truffles.</p>
